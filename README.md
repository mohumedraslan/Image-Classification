# Image-Classification
Image Classification
This exercise is about a basic task in computer vision, that is, image recognition. The NumPy and TensorFlow modules are required. The NumPy module is used to create image objects, and the TensorFlow framework is used to create deep learning algorithms and build CNNs. This exercise recognizes image classes based on the CIFAR10 dataset.
